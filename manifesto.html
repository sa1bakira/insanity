            Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.  "Teenager            <br>
            Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", <br>
            "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"... Damn kids.  They're all alike.<br>
            <br>
                    But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain,<br>
            ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what<br>
            made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?<br>
                    I am a hacker, enter my world...<br>
                    Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of<br>
            the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...<br>
                    Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.<br>
            <br>
                    I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain<br>
            for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  "No, Ms.<br>
            Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head..."<br>
                    Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.<br>
            <br>
                    I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is<br>
            cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I<br>
            screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...<br>
                            Or feels threatened by me...<br>
                            Or thinks I'm a smart ass...<br>
                            Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...<br>
                    Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.<br>
            <br>
                    And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through<br>
            the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is<br>
            sent out, a refuge from the <br>
            day-to-day incompetencies is sought...a board is found.<br>
                    "This is it... this is where I belong..."<br>
                    I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to<br>
            them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...<br>
                    Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike...<br>
            <br>
                    You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at<br>
            school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip<br>
            through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We've been dominated by sadists, or<br>
            ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us will-<br>
            ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.<br>
            <br>
                    This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the<br>
            beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying<br>
            for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and<br>
            you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek<br>
            after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,<br>
            without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.<br>
            You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us<br>
            and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.<br>
            <br>
                    Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is<br>
            that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.<br>
            My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never <br>
            forgive me for.<br>
                    I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,<br>
            but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.<br>
